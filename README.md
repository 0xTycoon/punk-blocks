# Welcome to PunkBlocks

This project deploys a contract to the Ethereum mainnet that can store 24x24 blocks of punk attributes as png images.

Each block is numbered and indexed by its name.

A view function the combines the attributes, outputting the composite image into a single SVG, embedded in a URI.

Anybody can register and store new punk block attributes, then use to create their own hybrid punks, or display the original punks. 

More info soon...
